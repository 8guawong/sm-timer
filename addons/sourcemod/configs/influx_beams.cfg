// Beam options:
//
// material		- .vmt file of the beam.
// download		- Adds given files to download table.
// displaytype	- "fullbeams", "beams" and "none"
// width		- Width of the beams.
// framerate	- Framerate, only really needed if animated(?)
// speed		- How fast the beams scroll. Steps of 10 seem to work the best.
// offset		- How much the beams are inset from their real bounds. By default half of width (players can always see them even if the zones touch walls).
// offset_z		- Same thing as above but for ground and ceiling. By default half of width (players can always see them even if the zones touch ground/ceiling).
// color		- Beam colors. (eg. "255 0 255 255")
